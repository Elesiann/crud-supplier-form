<h1> Welcome to Supp.li! </h1>

This is a CRUD SPA to manage your business' suppliers in a simple way!

The project is entirely made in React + Typescript, using Mantine as the main component library and styled-components for extra styling!
I've also used React Router, Firebase Auth to handle user authentication and for now, JSON-server as a mockup for entities.
